# Decktagram

Decktagram is the result of a simple idea to allow boardgamers to save precious table space and use a virtual deck of cards stored on a phone or tablet.

You can take photos of a deck of cards associated with a game, shuffle them and randomly draw them as you need them.

It is still under active development and more features will be added soon. If you find any bugs or have any feedback please let me know [here](https://forms.gle/tGRtd2y2P2iSXTZF8).
