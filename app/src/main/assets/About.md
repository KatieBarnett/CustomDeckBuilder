# Decktagram

Decktagram is the result of a simple idea to allow boardgamers to save precious table space and use a virtual deck of cards stored on a phone or tablet.

You can take photos of a deck of cards associated with a game, shuffle them and randomly draw them as you need them.

It is still under active development and more features will be added soon. If you find any bugs or have any feedback please let me know [here](https://forms.gle/tGRtd2y2P2iSXTZF8).

## Upcoming Features

Features I am aiming to add in the future (no specific timeline):

* Swiping to draw cards
* Updating images, naming & deleting cards in deck
* Adding game & deck images
* Editing of deck & game names
* Adding existing cards from one deck to another
* Tidy up of orphan images when decks or games are deleted
* Display of several decks at once and enable drawing from all displayed decks
* Upload decks to the cloud to backup/restore
